Phase 2 &nbsp; System Service Calls
</h3>
</center>

<b>Kernel Services to Processes</tt></b>
<ol>
<li>
During the runtime of processes, all system services are requested
through system-service calls (<tt>syscalls</tt>), in order for the
kernel to check the validity of the request, executes safe code,
synchronize processes (trapped and await for results). Our <tt>UserProc()</tt>
will make requests to try out the three new services as the goals
of this OS-construction phase: <tt>Write()</tt> <tt>GetPid()</tt>,
and <tt>Sleep()</tt>.
A <i>system service call</i> will cause the action to suspend the calling
process in order to execute the service code. Afterward the process
may either resume or be otherwise treated due to the outcome of what
is being requested (I/O waits, resources handling, etc.).
<li>
The service calls are in <b><i>syscalls.c</i></b> in which <i>inline</i>
assembly of CPU instructions are embedded, in order to invoke the kernel
code as an event. Particularly, the "<tt>int #</tt>" instruction which
is voluntarily coded to "interrupt" the process runtime itself and
the hardware will assist to switch CPU to execute the kernel code.
This is the main difference to a hardware event such as the timer.
There is no PIC mask to set, or IRQ to dismiss.
<li>
After the <i>int #</i> code of a <i>syscall</i>, the process will
eventually resume to execute the continuation code in the <i>syscalls.c</i>
or return to its original code from the call. An example is the
<tt>GetPid()</tt> call will retrieve the process ID via the
CPU <tt>EAX</tt> register. The code of the service handler
<tt>GetPidHandler</tt> would have placed the PID of the running
process (temporarily suspended) into the process frame, to be later
fetch by the syscall code as a function return value.
<li>
Similar to how <tt>TimerEvent</tt> is coded in <i>events.S</i>, the
<tt>SyscallEvent</tt> is to be added. The address of this new code
is to be added to the IDT at entry number <b>128</b>.
<li>
Coding details are listed in the <a href=WhatToCode.txt>WhatToCode.txt</a>.
</ol>

<b>Enable Kernel Services</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
The <tt><b>SYSCALL_EVENT</tt></b> is selected in the IDT at entry
128 (UNIX/Linux uses 0x80) where we shall register the address of
a <tt><b>SyscallEvent</tt></b> code module similar to the TimerEvent
in the <i><b>events.S</i></b>.
Both code modules are to be changed so each will push its own identifier
number into the process frame in the runtime stack. The TimerEvent
shall push TIMER_EVENT while SyscallEvent 128. Afterward, both
jump to a common routine <tt><b>TheRest</b></tt> to complete the
rest of the code which is the code in the original TimerEvent.
<li>
Different from the handling of a timer event, a syscall event
does not involve the PIC mask or dismissal of an IRQ. However,
the <i>API</i> will be provided in a program file <i><b>syscalls.c</i></b>
where <b><tt>asm()</tt></b> macros are used to embed CPU instructions
including <tt><b>int 128</b></tt> in order to "trap" the process
and switch the CPU to run the SyscallEvent code.
<li>
Each API code module should prepare what are to be given to the
kernel to perform the service, as well as receiving a return if
any is supposed to be given back to the calling process.
</ol>

<b>Kernel Service Handlers</b>
<ol>
<li>
Each service is actually performed by a handler function in the
program file <i>handlers.c</i>. A handler is called based on the
service request number given to the register EAX of the CPU by
the API code. This information will then be examined as the saved
value of the register is part of the process frame "trapped" by
the event handling code. The process frame pointer in the PCB
determines which handler to be executed by the kernel main code.
<li>
For the <tt>GetPid()</tt> call, the service number is a constant
<tt>GETPID 100</tt>, and the <tt>GetPidHandler()</tt> will
be called upon to handle it. What is to be done there is to return
the currently-running PID to the process via the process frame
(using a register) which will be loaded back by the ProcLoader
and the API code continues (after <tt>int 128</tt>) and it will
then retrieve it as the API function return value.
<li>
The <tt>Write()</tt> call will send to the kernel the service
request number (<tt>WRITE 4</tt>) in register EAX, the
<tt>STDOUT</tt> number (1) in EBX, and the character array
(address) in register ECX; in order for the kernel to call
the handler <tt>WriteHandler</tt> to process it. (Albeit it
is just a <i>cons_printf()</i> call in the handler.)
<li>
The <b><tt>SleepHandler()</tt></b> will compute the wake-up time
of the process by adding the current time <tt>timer_tick</tt> and
<tt>100 x sleep seconds requested</tt>, and keept the result in
the PCB. The state of the process is altered to <i>SLEEPING</i>
and the running PID is reset to -1.
<li>
The <tt>TimerHandler()</tt> will first upcount the current time
indicator <i>timer_ticks</i> and check if any processes need to
be waken: loop through each PCB -- if asleep and wakeup time
arrives, enqueue PID to the run queue and alter its state.
Other code in the TimerHandler remains.
</ul>
</ol>

<b>Deliverables</b>
<ul>
As before, via the SAMBA client <i>smbclient</i> to submit only the
source files (not binary files or intermediate compiler files) into
your team folder under the folder <i>phase2</i>.
</ul>

<b>Review Questions</b>
<ol>
<li>
Point out the differences between the setup and handling of a hardware
interrupt (such as the timer), and a syscall?
<li>
Why bother saving the process frame pointer at the beginning of Kernel()?
<li>
How to check the wake time against the current time to wake? Will "=="
be enough? Or a ">=" is needed?
<li>
What can happen with <i>your</i> current code if testing with "Sleep(0)"
or "Sleep(-1)?" What is a good strategy to handle for these exceptions?
<li>
Can the current time become different to the real time (wall clock) after
after given some runtime that is sufficiently lengthy?
<li>
What differs a cooperative OS versus a preemptive one? What can be the
pros and cons?
